In the distant future, the priestess Dahlia has a vision of a boy who will end the strife between man and machine. But when the savior she foresaw appears, backed by the powerful Cardinal Skye, Dahlia must unravel the boy's secret before war consumes the Empire.

 

Tom Claburn is a new, lyrical voice in the clichéd realms of fantasy. His inventive use of language and symbols reminds me of Gene Wolfe's creative word-play in his multi-volume series, The Book of the New Sun.
