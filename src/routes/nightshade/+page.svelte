<p>Andrea's debut album "Nightshade" now available on cdbaby, Amazon, and iTunes.</p>
    <p>"The jazz here is extraordinary."
        <p>— David Wiegand, KQED's The Do List, January 19, 2017</p>
<p>"Claburn’s highly instrumental use of her voice is… riveting to hear… This is one of the most auspicious recording debuts for a jazz singer I’ve heard… Highly recommended."</p>
<p>— Lynn René Bayley, The Art Music Lounge</p>
<p>"This is a well thought out record, an impressive calling card for a vocalist who has taken the time to grow into herself… Nightshade has a seriousness that is at the same time engaging and entertaining. Much respect is due to Andrea Claburn, a naturally gifted singer who has taken the time and done the hard work necessary to become something more – a very interesting and capable composer and arranger."</p>
<p>— Mark Christian Miller, Mark Heard It First</p>
